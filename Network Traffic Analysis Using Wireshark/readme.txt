This project focuses on analyzing a security incident involving a travel agency's website. The scenario involves the detection of a service interruption and the subsequent investigation to determine the cause. The security analyst receives an automated alert indicating a problem with the web server and discovers a high volume of TCP SYN requests originating from an unfamiliar IP address. The analyst concludes that the web server is under a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, resulting in a connection timeout error for users trying to access the website. To mitigate the attack, the analyst temporarily takes the server offline and blocks the offending IP address on the firewall. However, the analyst recognizes the need for further actions to address the ongoing threat and prevent future incidents. The project aims to identify the attack type, explain its impact on the web server and employees, and develop strategies to stop the attacker and enhance network security measures. By understanding network attacks and their implications, the project contributes to troubleshooting network issues and implementing effective countermeasures to safeguard the organization's network infrastructure.
