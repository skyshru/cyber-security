This project focuses on the analysis of DNS (Domain Name System) and ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) traffic using a network protocol analyzer tool. The goal is to identify the network protocol affected during a cybersecurity incident involving the inaccessibility of a company's website. By examining the log files and capturing data packets, the project aims to determine which network protocol and service were impacted, leading to the error message "destination port unreachable." This analysis helps cybersecurity analysts assess security risks, reinforce network security, and contribute to incident resolution.
