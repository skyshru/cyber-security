This project focuses on a security incident that occurred on the cooking website, yummyrecipesforme.com. As a cybersecurity analyst, the objective is to investigate, document, and provide recommendations to address the security problem faced by website visitors. The incident involves a disgruntled baker who executed a brute force attack to gain unauthorized access to the web host's administrative account. By successfully guessing the default password, the attacker was able to modify the website's source code, leading to the prompt for users to download a malicious file. This file redirected users to a fraudulent version of the website where the recipes were made available for free.

The project involves analyzing a tcpdump log to identify the network protocols utilized in establishing connections between users and the website. Understanding these protocols is crucial in identifying potential security breaches and implementing effective security measures. The incident will be thoroughly documented, highlighting the attacker's methods and the impact on users' devices. Additionally, recommendations will be provided to prevent future brute force attacks, considering the compromised admin password and the absence of preventive controls.

By undertaking this project, the aim is to deepen the understanding of network security, attack vectors, and the significance of implementing robust security measures. The project's findings and recommendations can serve as valuable insights to protect against unauthorized access and mitigate the risk of malicious activities on the website.
