This project revolves around the analysis of a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack incident within a multimedia company. The primary objective is to utilize the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF) to create an incident report and formulate an effective plan for bolstering network security. By employing the five functions of the CSF - Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover - the project aims to identify risks, implement protective measures, enhance monitoring capabilities, respond to incidents, and restore affected systems. The ultimate goal is to strengthen the company's security posture and mitigate potential future vulnerabilities, ensuring a robust and resilient network environment.

In this project, cybersecurity analysts will conduct regular audits to identify security gaps in the internal networks, systems, devices, and access privileges. Through the implementation of policies, procedures, training, and relevant tools, internal assets will be safeguarded against cyber threats. The project will also focus on enhancing detection capabilities, enabling swift identification of potential security incidents. A comprehensive incident response plan will be developed to contain and neutralize security incidents while analyzing their impact on the network. Finally, measures will be taken to recover affected systems, restoring normal operations and preserving data and assets. By following the NIST CSF and adopting a proactive approach, this project will contribute to enhancing network security and resilience within the multimedia company.
